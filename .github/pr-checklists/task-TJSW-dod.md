# A Tiny JS World -- (pre-OOP) exercise check list

Let's do some self-checks to fix most common issues and to make some improvements to the code while reviewers find some time to dedicate it to your submission.

Go through the checklist below, fix code as appropriate and **mark fulfilled requirements when you genuinely believe you are done**.

Please, feel free to ask questions here or seek for help in the Students' chat.

## Check-list - definition of done

- [ ] Code is [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself), which means that whenever you see a pattern in your code those should be eliminated as much as possible. Examples:
    - `print(dog); print(cat); etc ... ` should be refactored employing `Array.forEach` as the least
    - `` `${obj.legs}; ${obj.name}; etc...` `` (yes, strings are also code) must be refactored employing appropriate `Array` methods
- [ ] Properties used to form an object presentation string must be explicitly listed/specified
- [ ] `Object` methods like `keys`, `values`, `entries` shouldn't be used as these do not guarantee any particular order of keys/values

_Sincerely yours,_
